### DW-1: Restore the ten pre-existing failing cases in the excluded Bun proposal test file.
origin: spec-deferred 542cee466154
location: tests/chatProposals.test.ts
source_spec: `9-bounded-chat-context-windowed-proposals-empty-reads-on-missing-threads.md`
severity: medium
reason: At baseline 4b38e6c891f35be9e8dea57aec6622812f8cddaa, `bun test tests/chatProposals.test.ts` reported 12 passing and 10 failing cases. After the Story 9 review patches it reports the same 12 passing and 10 failing cases, while the Story 9 `proposal access` subset passes 4 of 4.
status: open

### DW-2: Follow-up review still recommended for 9 after the damping cap was spent
origin: review-budget-followup
location: n/a
source_spec: `9-bounded-chat-context-windowed-proposals-empty-reads-on-missing-threads.md`
severity: low
reason: The follow-up-review damping cap (limits.max_followup_reviews = 1) was spent with the story finalized (status: done, verify green) while the review pass still recommended an independent follow-up. The work was committed by bmad-loop run 20260901-192212-7e0e; this entry preserves the lingering recommendation for a deliberate later review.
