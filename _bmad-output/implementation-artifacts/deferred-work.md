### DW-1: Restore the ten pre-existing failing cases in the excluded Bun proposal test file.
origin: spec-deferred 542cee466154
location: tests/chatProposals.test.ts
source_spec: `9-bounded-chat-context-windowed-proposals-empty-reads-on-missing-threads.md`
severity: medium
reason: At baseline 4b38e6c891f35be9e8dea57aec6622812f8cddaa, `bun test tests/chatProposals.test.ts` reported 12 passing and 10 failing cases. After the Story 9 review patches it reports the same 12 passing and 10 failing cases, while the Story 9 `proposal access` subset passes 4 of 4.
status: open

### DW-2: Follow-up review still recommended for 9 after the damping cap was spent
origin: review-budget-followup
location: n/a
source_spec: `9-bounded-chat-context-windowed-proposals-empty-reads-on-missing-threads.md`
severity: low
reason: The follow-up-review damping cap (limits.max_followup_reviews = 1) was spent with the story finalized (status: done, verify green) while the review pass still recommended an independent follow-up. The work was committed by bmad-loop run 20260901-192212-7e0e; this entry preserves the lingering recommendation for a deliberate later review.
status: open

### DW-3: A deployment can change the live prompt program while an already-started generation is still running.
origin: spec-deferred 96dbf2f50b46
location: convex/ai/pipeline.ts, convex/ai/iterative.ts, convex/ai/instrument.ts
source_spec: `10-generations-record-prompt-version-hash-and-learning-digest-ids.md`
severity: low
reason: The approved design stamps promptVersion atomically at beginGeneration and intentionally does not re-verify it at later provider handoffs, so a mid-flight generation may finish under mixed deployed code while retaining its start-time hash.
status: open

### DW-4: Generation-owned Voyage query-embedding and rerank usage remains outside Story 10 attribution.
origin: spec-deferred 441c1cd5bc10
location: convex/ai/brainRetrieval.ts, convex/ai/brain/retrieve.ts
source_spec: `10-generations-record-prompt-version-hash-and-learning-digest-ids.md`
severity: high
reason: The existing Brain retrieval path writes aiUsage rows but does not pass generationId or durationMs; candidateRunId is not applicable because retrieval occurs before candidate runs.
status: open

### DW-5: Digest provenance can grow after terminal status through post-QA or late in-flight calls.
origin: spec-deferred f3ddbb267ea5
location: convex/generations.ts, convex/ai/postQa.ts, convex/ai/pipeline.ts
source_spec: `10-generations-record-prompt-version-hash-and-learning-digest-ids.md`
severity: high
reason: The approved story design permits completed post-QA attribution, and the union mutation has no terminal fence, so late ghost calls can also extend the union.
status: open

### DW-6: Partial candidate retries do not define ownership for copied candidate provenance and usage.
origin: spec-deferred 7403dbc2733c
location: convex/generations.ts
source_spec: `10-generations-record-prompt-version-hash-and-learning-digest-ids.md`
severity: high
reason: retryFailedCandidates can copy a successful candidate into a newly hashed generation while its original usage and report provenance remain keyed to the prior generation.
status: open

### DW-7: The prompt-program manifest does not cover every stable provider-visible rule.
origin: spec-deferred 2b000c09e95e
location: convex/ai/promptProgram.ts, convex/ai/qaChecks.ts, convex/ai/structured.ts, shared/craScienceCodes.ts
source_spec: `10-generations-record-prompt-version-hash-and-learning-digest-ids.md`
severity: high
reason: Review found omitted deterministic QA rendering, structured validation summaries, CRA science-code labels, and recovery routes, plus descriptive fields that runtime code does not consume.
status: open

### DW-8: Usage persistence and attribution integrity remain best effort in rare failure or caller-error paths.
origin: spec-deferred 50914cf5f212
location: convex/ai/instrument.ts, convex/aiUsage.ts
source_spec: `10-generations-record-prompt-version-hash-and-learning-digest-ids.md`
severity: high
reason: A simultaneous scheduler and fallback mutation failure drops returned usage, and logUsage does not validate generation, candidate, and project relationships.
status: open

### DW-9: Some generation entry and artifact boundaries lack full integration coverage.
origin: spec-deferred f97517052e1a
location: convex/generationAttribution.test.ts, convex/ai/instrument.test.ts
source_spec: `10-generations-record-prompt-version-hash-and-learning-digest-ids.md`
severity: medium
reason: Iterative stamping and style-digest restoration, scheduled candidate arguments, retrieval usage, and provider-to-index persistence are covered at component seams rather than one complete flow.
status: open

### DW-10: Fourteen legacy tests/*.test.ts files still import bun:test and are executed by no script or CI job.
origin: spec-deferred 482a6ce62b45
location: tests/*.test.ts, vitest.config.ts
source_spec: `10-generations-record-prompt-version-hash-and-learning-digest-ids.md`
severity: low
reason: package.json defines no bun test script, vitest.config.ts includes only convex, shared, src, and the explicitly added tests/aiUsage.test.ts, and CI runs only npm run check and npm test, so those suites never run anywhere. Pre-existing; surfaced while reviewing the single-file Vitest migration.
status: open

### DW-11: Follow-up review still recommended for 10 after the damping cap was spent
origin: review-budget-followup
location: n/a
source_spec: `10-generations-record-prompt-version-hash-and-learning-digest-ids.md`
severity: low
reason: The follow-up-review damping cap (limits.max_followup_reviews = 1) was spent with the story finalized (status: done, verify green) while the review pass still recommended an independent follow-up. The work was committed by bmad-loop run 20260901-192212-7e0e; this entry preserves the lingering recommendation for a deliberate later review.

### DW-12: getGeneration now takes a read dependency on the whole aiUsage by_generationId range, so every scheduled logUsage insert invalidates the live GenerationProgress subscription and re-pushes the full gen
origin: spec-deferred 30e515bd62ef
location: convex/generations.ts:180
source_spec: `11-getgeneration-exposes-attributable-cost-with-legacy-null-semantics.md`
severity: medium
reason: src/lib/components/generation/GenerationProgress.svelte:19 subscribes to api.generations.getGeneration for the duration of a run, and logUsage is scheduled per provider call (tens per generation). The in-query sum is required by this story's intent ("computed inside the same query", partial sum while in flight), so it is not fixable here; a stored running total on the generation row, or a separate cost query the progress card does not subscribe to, would remove the churn.
status: open

### DW-13: Per-generation dollar cost is now readable by any internal role while the aggregate usageReport stays admin-gated, and the widening is recorded only in this story file, not in docs/product-domain.md.
origin: spec-deferred 17d0f20a8246
location: docs/product-domain.md
source_spec: `11-getgeneration-exposes-attributable-cost-with-legacy-null-semantics.md`
severity: medium
reason: getInternalProjectAccessOrNull (convex/lib/auth.ts:33-42) admits writer, manager, and admin for any project, whereas convex/aiUsage.ts gates usageReport behind usageViewerOrNull. The story forbids adding a gate, so the code is correct as specified, but the domain contract should say who may see spend at generation granularity.
status: open

### DW-14: No function in convex/generations.ts declares a returns validator, so the convex-lint hook warns on every edit to the file.
origin: spec-deferred 8dea7e53e38b
location: convex/generations.ts
source_spec: `11-getgeneration-exposes-attributable-cost-with-legacy-null-semantics.md`
severity: low
reason: Pre-existing and file-wide, not introduced by this story; adding one to getGeneration alone would have been a non-additive change outside scope. Worth a focused pass over the file.
